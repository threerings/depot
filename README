Depot Persistence Library
-------------------------

Depot is a relational persistence library for Java. It is an ORM library, but
has aims that are somewhat different from the popular "managed" persistence
libraries like Hibernate and others.

Website
-------

See the Depot website for documentation and other info:

  http://code.google.com/p/depot/

Building
--------

The library is built using ant. It can be found here:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

If you use build-ivy.xml to build, the necessary dependencies will be
automatically fetched by Ivy (which will itself be downloaded if needed).

To compile the code and generate a jar file, invoke:

  % ant -f build-ivy.xml dist

Invoke 'ant -f build-ivy.xml -p' to see information on other build targets.

Depot also provides .classpath and .project files for Eclipse users which
require that you set an EXT_LIBS_DIR variable indicating the location of the
external jar dependencies. The Depot Eclipse project also depends on the
Eclipse project for the samskivert library. That library can be found at:

  http://code.google.com/p/samskivert/

License and Distribution
------------------------

Depot is released under the LGPL. This means you are free to use Depot on any
project, open source or proprietary, but that any modifications made to the
library must be made available to the maintainers. See COPYING for more
detailed information.

The most recent version of the Depot source code is available at the website
listed above.
