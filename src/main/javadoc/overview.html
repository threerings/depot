    <a href="https://github.com/threerings/depot/">Depot</a> is something like an
    ORM library in Java, but has aims that are somewhat different from the
    popular "managed" persistence libraries like Hibernate and others.

    <h3>Design Goals</h3>

    <ul>
    <li><p> Eliminate (as much as possible) the use of raw SQL (or any textual
        query language), instead providing Java classes that allow the
        expressions of queries and updates in as concise but compile-time
        checkable a manner as possible. </p>

    <li><p> Reduce the pain of schema and data migrations as much as possible,
        but not so much that the system used to do the migrations is too
        complex for anyone to understand or use properly. </p>

    <li><p> Use annotations to layer database metadata over the top of (almost)
        POJOs. </p>

    <li><p> Use annotations that are syntactically and semantically equivalent
        to EJB3 persistence annotations wherever possible. </p>

    <li><p> Support multiple database backends (currently MySQL and Postgresql). </p>

    <li><p> Provide caching support (currently integrated with EHCache). </p>

    <li><p> Keep an eye toward eventual support for sharded databases. </p>
    </ul>

    <p> I and others who have contributed to the library hope that you find it
      useful, easy to use and time saving. Comments and contributions are
      always welcome.
